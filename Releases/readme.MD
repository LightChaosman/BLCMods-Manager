Each subfolder in this folder will be checked for automatic updates by the BLCMM Launcher.
Each subfolder contains a .txt file, whose filename is the version number of the most recent release.
The actual release is then again stored in a subfolder, whose folder name is the same as the version name.
This final subfolder contains the actual release, and an optional options file.
